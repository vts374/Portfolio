				<h3 id="facts">10 Things You Didn’t Know About Albert Einstein:</h3>

		</div>
		<ul id="tribute-info">
			<li>He never failed math. This is a popular “fact” promoted on the internet, maybe in an attempt to relate
				to
				genius.
				However, it is simply not true. Overall, Einstein was an average student, but <em> math was one area
					where
					he
					excelled,</em>
				unsurprisingly.</li>
			<li>Einstein encouraged the development of the <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon">Nuclear
					bomb</a> . His involvement is often misinterpreted, with some
				claiming that he helped create the atom bomb. In reality, what he did was write a letter to President
				FDR
				encouraging him to begin work on such a weapon, which led to the Manhattan Project. Although a dedicated
				pacifist and, later, an anti-nuke spokesman, Einstein was convinced that America needed the atomic bomb
				before the Nazis.</li>
			<li>He was a great musician. If the whole “genius” thing didn't work out, Einstein could have become a
				violinist. His mother
				played piano so he had the love of music instilled in him—via violin lessons—at the young age of five.
			</li>
			<li>He could have been the President of Israel. When Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, died,
				Einstein
				was offered
				the position, but he declined.</li>
			<li>He married his cousin. After Einstein divorced his first wife, Mileva Maric, he married his cousin, Elsa
				Lowenthal. He
				was, actually, quite a bad husband to his first wife in their later years. He had affairs he never tried
				to
				hide, he
				moved the entire family to Berlin without discussion, and treated her more as a servant than a wife.
			</li>
			<li>He won the 1921 <i> Nobel Prize for Physics.</i> This alone isn't particularly surprising. What is
				surprising is the
				fact that
				he didn't receive it for the general or special theory of relativity, but rather for the photoelectric
				effect.</li>
			<li>He loved to sail. Ever since university, Einstein sailed as a hobby. But by his own admission, he never
				made
				a
				particularly good sailor. In fact, he didn't even know how to swim.</li>
			<li>He really didn't like socks, and usually didn't wear them. In fact, in a letter to Elsa, he bragged
				about
				getting away
				“without wearing socks” while at Oxford.</li>
			<li>He had an illegitimate daughter. This wasn't known until the 1980s, but according to correspondence
				between
				Albert and
				Mileva it was determined that the two had a daughter in 1902 called Lieserl. At one point, all mention
				of
				her in letters
				stopped so her fate is unknown.</li>
			<li>His brain was stolen. After Einstein died, the pathologist who did his autopsy took his brain without
				permission. He
				eventually got the permission necessary from Einstein's son, but he was fired from Princeton when he
				refused
				to turn the
				brain over. He kept it for over forty years before finally returning it in 1998.</li>
		</ul>
		<q><b>The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason
				for existing.</b></q>
